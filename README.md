# Zelastic

Zero-downtime Elasticsearch tooling for managing indices and indexing from
ActiveRecord with PostgreSQL to Elasticsearch.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zelastic'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zelastic

## Usage

### Setup

For each ActiveRecord scope you want to index, you'll need a configuration:
```ruby
class MyModel < ApplicationRecord
  ...
end

MyModelIndex = Zelastic.new(
  client: Elasticsearch::Client.new(...),
  mapping: {
    ...
  },
  data_source: MyModel.some_scope
) do |my_model|
  # this block transforms an instance of MyModel into the hash which goes into Elasticsearch
  {
    attr_1: my_model.attr_1,
    attr_2: my_model.attr_2,
    attr_3: my_model.attr_3
  }
end
```

You can also override some defaults, if you wish:
- `index_settings`: by default there aren't any, but you can provide, for example, custom analysers
  here
- `read_alias`: by default this is the table name of the `data_source`
- `write_alias`: by default this is the `read_alias`, with `_write` appended

If you pass an array to as the `client` argument, all writes will be applied to every client in the
array.

### Normal usage

You'll need to make sure the following gets run whenever an instance of MyModel is updated:

```ruby
indexer = Zelastic::Indexer.new(MyModelIndex)
indexer.index_record(my_model)
```

And when an instance of MyModel gets deleted:
```ruby
indexer = Zelastic::Indexer.new(MyModelIndex)
indexer.delete_by_id(my_model.id)
```

There's also some bulk-change methods which may be useful:
```ruby
indexer = Zelastic::Indexer.new(MyModelIndex)
indexer.index_batch(MyModel.where(id: [...]))
indexer.delete_by_ids([1, 2, 3])
indexer.delete_by_query(elasticsearch_query)
```

### Re-indexing

Sometimes you'll need to do a full reindex - maybe because of a bug which left the index in a bad
state, or because of a new index definition, or...anything else.

We use index aliases to make it easy to do zero-downtime reindexing. The actual indexes are
`<read_alias>_<random>`. The `read_alias` points to the single "current" index.
The `write_alias` is usually the same as the read alias, except during re-indexing, where it
points at both the old and new indices, so both receive writes. The following steps run a
full reindex:

1. `new_name = SecureRandom.hex(3)`
2. `index_manager = Zelastic::IndexManager.new(MyModelIndex, client: Elasticsearch::Client.new(...))`
2. `index_manager.create_index(new_name)`
3. `index_manager.populate_index(new_name, batch_size: 3000)`
4. Check that the new index is looking alrightish
5. `index_manager.switch_read_index(new_name)`
6. Probably do some more checks, then
7. `index_manager.stop_dual_writes`
8. `index_manager.cleanup_old_indices`

The `client` keyword argument to `Zelastic::IndexManager.new` is optional. It defaults to the client
passed to `Zelastic::Config.new`, if one client is passed, or the first client in the array, if an
array is passed to `Zelastic::Config.new`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
